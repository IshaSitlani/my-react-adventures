Why we use react?
=>makes easy to manage and build complex front end

Why was React created?
-facebook met with a problem of phantom messages
phantom messages typically refer to notifications or alerts indicating the presence of a new message, even when there is no actual new message.

facebook me you can chat with people from 3 different options . ab hota kya tha ki agr mne chatbox se message pdhliya fir bhi message ka notification count(jse ki 1,2,3) hat ta nhi tha ye thi problem , ki agr mne message pdh liya hai toh upar q count likha aa rha hai?

ab hota kya tha ki state ( variable ki state ki vha pr 1 dikhana hai ki 5 ) was managed by javascript and UI was managed by DOM ,toh js aur UI me koi sync hi nhi tha ki js DOM ko bta paye ki 1 bhi message nhi hai toh UI m kuch mat show kro. is dikkt k krn occur hoti thi phantom message ki dikkt ki message na hote sote bhi notification count dikhta tha.

ye problem of INCONSISTENT UI ko solve krne k liye bna react in 2011 by facebook team 
The development of React started as an internal project by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, in 2011.

React was then open-sourced by Facebook in May 2013
 
then khan academy and unsplash adopted React

consistency of React made it popular 

React is a library 

library vs framework?

library:- A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to optimize tasks. It provides specific functionality and is typically focused on a particular area or task
(COOL DUDE)
Control: You are in control of the application. You decide when and where to call the library.

eg:-React JS , GSAP , FRAMER MOTION , bootstrap , sheryJS

framework:-A framework is a comprehensive platform for building software applications. It provides a foundation and predefined structure that developers follow, enforcing a certain way to build and organize code.

Control: The framework is in control of the application's flow. It dictates the architecture and flow of the application.
(MILITARY -strict rules)
eg:- Next JS , Angular
